# useAsyncInitialize()

This custom hook in React is designed to handle asynchronous initialization of a component. It allows you to initialize a component's state or perform other setup tasks asynchronously, ensuring that the component is only rendered after the initialization is complete.

## Code

``` useAsyncInitialize.ts 
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export const useAsyncInitialize = <T>(
  func: () => Promise<T>,
  deps: unknown[] = []
) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState<T | undefined>();

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      setState(await func());
    })();
  }, deps);

  return state;
};
```
