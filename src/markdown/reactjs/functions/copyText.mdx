# copyText()

This custom hook in React is designed to handle asynchronous initialization of a component. It allows you to initialize a component's state or perform other setup tasks asynchronously, ensuring that the component is only rendered after the initialization is complete.

## Code

``` copyText.ts
const copyText = async (text: string) => {
  try {
    await navigator.clipboard.writeText(text);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
```

## Example 

``` javascript

copyText("Copy now!");
```
